## starter

@0xctopus I made the starter myself :) only took a week and it's super easy! Here's the recipe I used.

Day 1: (5:00pm)
- add 50 grams of whole wheat flour and 50 grams of water to a jar. Mix until there are no lumps.

Day 2:
- add 50 grams whole wheat flour and 50 grams of water to the same jar and mix. 

Day 3: 
- throw away 100 grams of your starter 
- then, add 100 grams of whole wheat flour and water and mix 

Day 4:
- throw away 150 grams of your starter
- then, add 100 grams of whole wheat flour and water and mix

Day 5:
- throw away 200 grams of your starter 
- then, add 150 grams of whole wheat flour and water and mix

Day 6:
- throw away 250 grams of your starter 
- then add 200 grams of whole wheat flour and water and mix

Day 7:
- your starter should be bubbly and read to bake with. 
- feed the starter everyday with the same amount remaining after daily discarding. 
- foe example, if after discarding some of my starter, I have 100 grams of starter remaining, I will feed it 100 grams of flour and water :)


## the bread itself

Two days before I make the dough:

- 11:00am: feed 15 grams of starter, 15g water + 15g whole wheat flour(wwf)
- 11:00pm: discard all but 15 grams of that starter and feed it 15g water + 15g wwf

Day before I make the dough:
- 10:00am: discard all but 15 grams of that starter and feed it 15g water + 15g wwf
- 5:00pm: discard all but 15 grams of that starter and feed it 15g water + 15g wwf
- 11:00pm: discard all but 5 grams (yes, five grams) of that starter and feed it 20g water +20g wwf

The day you make the dough:
- 8:00am: make the levain [A levain is an extremely active starter (which you have created by feeding your normal starter twice in one day, then three times the following day) that is then fed double its weight. It is the leavening agent that will give your bread rise] 
discard all but 35 grams of your starter and feed it 35g of wwf, 35g of bread flour, and 70g of water
- 12:00pm: autolyse your dough [An autolyse is roughly incorporating flour and water and letting it rest so that the gluten has a little more time to develop. This helps the kneeding process.
Mix together very roughly, 140g wwf, 510g bread flour and 470g water (90 degrees F), then let it rest alongside your levain. This will yeild a doughh at about 73% hydration, which I find is the sweet spot for an open crumb and dough that is easier to work with.
- 2:00pm: add your levain, and mix thoroughly. Then, slap the dough onto the counter and fold it over itself as seen at 3:05 in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJpIzr2sCDE&t=2s Then cover the dough and let it rest in a warm environment
- 3:00pm: add 12 grams of salt to your dough, and then do the same series of slapping the dough on the counter and folding it over itself. Let it rest in a warm environment.
- 5:00pm: your dough should be VERY elastic at this point. You should be able to stretch it out and see through the dough




Laminate the dough, as seen in this video at 7:09 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJEjW-QSnQ Then, let it rest in a warm environment
6:00pm: perform a coil fold as seen at 8:49 in that same video. cover and let rest
7:00pm: do another coil fold
7:30pm: shape the dough as seen at 12:31 in the same video, then let it rest on the counter
9:00pm: put the dough into the fridge over night

The next morning:
- 9:00am: preheat your oven to 450 degrees F and stick your dutch oven inside to heat up. Once the oven is at temperature, drop your dough inside, score it lengthwise and bake with the lid on for 20mins. Take the lid off and let the bread bake for another 15-20mins. This recipe should yield 2 loaves!
