Credit: Gordon Ramsay

## Ingredients

* 2 pounds tomatoes, cored and diced
* 1 yellow onion, finely diced
* Â¾ cup brown sugar, packed
* 3 tablespoons lemon juice
* 2 tablespoons harissa paste (more if you want an extra kick)
* 1 teaspoon ground coriander
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt

## Assembly

* Hearty Artisan Bread, sliced and toasted
* Arugula 
* Poached eggs
* Feta cheese, crumbled
* Preserved lemons, chopped (Alex: I skip this)
* Thinly shaved red onions, soaked in ice water for 5 minutes then patted dry
* Extra virgin olive oil
* Flaky salt
* Freshly cracked black pepper

## Cooking instructions

Combine all ingredients in a medium pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Lower heat and simmer rapidly for 55 minutes - 1 hour and 15 minutes. Once done, the jam should be thick and most of the moisture should have evaporated. The jam will also thicken slightly as it cools. Leftover cooled jam can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. 

To assemble, spread a generous amount of tomato jam on toasted bread and top with dots of feta cheese and arugula, followed by preserved lemon and red onion. Nestle a poached egg on top and sprinkle with flaky salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil and dollop with more tomato jam, if desired.
